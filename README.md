📰 Fake News Detection with AI
(Replace the link above with your app's URL once you deploy it)

This is a multi-layer AI application that combines a traditional machine learning model with a large language model (LLM) to classify, analyze, and explain news articles.

✨ Features
Dual-AI Analysis: Uses a fast, locally-trained scikit-learn model for an initial prediction and the powerful Google Gemini API for in-depth analysis.

Explainable AI (XAI): A "Model Thinking" tab with a Plotly bar chart shows why the local model made its decision by ranking the most influential words.

Rich Visualizations: A Plotly Gauge chart provides a clear "Fake" or "Real" verdict with a confidence score.

Source Verification: The Gemini model (gemini-2.5-pro) attempts to find and link to real-time sources to corroborate real news stories.

Responsive UI: Built with Streamlit, featuring a clean layout with a sidebar, main content area, and tabs that work on both desktop and mobile.

Hybrid Training Data: The local model is trained on a robust, hybrid dataset:

Fake News: Sourced from a popular Kaggle dataset (political).

Real News: Sourced from the Hugging Face datasets library ("AG News") for topic diversity (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech).

🧠 How it Works: The Two-Layer AI
This project demonstrates the power of combining two different types of AI:

The Specialist (Local Model): A LogisticRegression model trained on over 150,000 articles. It is extremely fast and accurate at identifying news similar to its training data. Its "thinking" is based on word coefficients (shown in the "Model Thinking" tab).

The Generalist (LLM): The gemini-2.5-pro model acts as a generalist. It was not trained on this dataset. It understands the context, tone, and nuance of any topic (finance, tech, sports) and can perform real-time web searches to verify claims.

🚀 How to Run This Project
1. Prerequisites
You must have Python 3.9+ installed.

2. Create requirements.txt
In your project folder, create a file named requirements.txt and paste the following lines into it:

Plaintext

streamlit
pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
google-generativeai
python-dotenv
plotly
datasets
matplotlib
seaborn
3. Setup and Installation
Follow these steps in your terminal:

Clone the Repository (or download the files):

Bash

git clone https://your-repo-link-here.git
cd fake-news-detector
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

Bash

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate on Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
Install All Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Create Your .env File: Create a file named .env in the same folder. Open it and add your Google API key:

GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Download the Training Data:

Fake News: Download Fake.csv from this Kaggle dataset and place it in your project folder.

Real News: Run the download_data.py script once to fetch the "AG News" dataset from Hugging Face.

Bash

python download_data.py
(This will create True_diverse.csv in your folder.)

Train Your Model: Run the train.py script. This will read Fake.csv and True_diverse.csv, train the model, and save the fake_news_model.joblib and vectorizer.joblib files.

Bash

python train.py
Run the App: You're ready to go!

Bash

streamlit run app.py
Your app will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501.
